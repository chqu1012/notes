Following the getting started guide, these are the required steps to run JavaFX 11 from Eclipse.

1 Install Eclipse 2018-09 from here.

2 Install JDK 11 from here.

3 Add Java 11 as an installed JRE to Eclipse: Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs -> Add.

4 Download JavaFX 11 ea from here.

5 Create a User Library: Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries -> New. Name it JavaFX11 and include the jars under the lib folder from JavaFX 11-ea.

6 Create a Java project. You don't need to add a module-path class. Make sure that you select Java 11 and you add the JavaFX11 library to the project's modulepath.

7 Add a package javafx11 and the main application class HelloFX:

package javafx11;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;


public class HelloFX extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        String version = System.getProperty("java.version");
        Label l = new Label ("Hello, JavaFX 11, running on "+version);
        Scene scene = new Scene (new StackPane(l), 300, 200);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

}
Note that the editor shouldn't complain about JavaFX classes, as we have included the user library.

8 Add runtime arguments. Edit the project's run configuration, and add these VM arguments:

--module-path C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\javafx-sdk-11\lib --add-modules=javafx.controls
9 Finally, run the project. It should work fine.
